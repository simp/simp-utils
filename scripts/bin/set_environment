#
# This is a YAML-based node classifier which can be used as a Puppet
# External Node Classifier (ENC). It identifies the environment for
# a Puppet client, based on rules listed in a user-provided
# configuration file, '/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/environments.yaml'.
#
# INPUTS/OUTPUTS
# This script should be called with a Puppet client FQDN as a
# single command line argument.
#
# It will return a YAML-formatted string with a single key,
# 'environment'.
#
# For example,
#
#   cmdline$  /usr/local/bin/set_environment foo1.bar
#   ---
#   environment: production
#
#
# CONFIGURATION
# Each rule in '/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/environments.yaml' should have
# the following format:
#
#      <regex/hostname> : <environment>
#
# where,
#
# <regex/hostname>: May be either a regular expression or a simple
#                   string that matches against the FQDN of the system.
#
#      NOTE: The rule *must* have '/' as the first and last character
#            if it is a regex.
#
# <environment>: A string representation of the environment. This is
#                what will be passed back to the Puppet Server
#
# Rules are processed from the top down and the first match wins!
# If no match is found or 'environment.yaml' does not exist, this
# script will return the default environment: 'production'.
#
# EXAMPLE
#
# ---
# 'foo1.bar' : 'production' => Matches only 'foo1.bar' and places it in the
#                              'production' environment.
#
# '/^foo\.bar/' : 'foobar'  => Matches all hosts that start with foo.bar and
#                              places them in the 'foobar' environment.
#
# USAGE
#
# 1. Ensure this script can be executed by the Puppet server.
#
# 2. Configure Puppet to use this script as an ENC
#    a. Add, or change, the line 'node_terminus' to 'exec' in the
#       [master] section of puppet.conf.
#    b. Set the 'external_nodes' entry in the [master] section of
#       puppet.conf to point to this script.
#
#    The resulting lines should look something like this:
#
#      ...
#      [master]
#      ...
#      node_terminus = exec
#      external_nodes = /usr/local/bin/set_environment
#      ...
#
# 3. Add the file '/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/environments.yaml' to
#    your system.
#
#    NOTE:  You can verify that the file is properly formatted
#    and yields the classification desired by running this script
#    manually.  For example,
#
#    /usr/local/bin/set_environment foo1.bar
#
# 4. Restart the Puppet Server process
#
#

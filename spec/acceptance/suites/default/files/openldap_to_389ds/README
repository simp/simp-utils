The following files are used in the tests for the OpenLDAP to 389DS convert
and import scripts.

* simp_openldap.ldif - slapcat output of the OpenLDAP server at the end of the
  simp-core LDAP test in which
  - LDAP groups and users were added and then the users were associated with
    secondary groups
  - In LDAP `pwdReset` was set to TRUE for all users to enforce password
    changes upon login
  - Two of the users ('admin2', 'auditor1') logged in and reset their passwords
* malformed_simp_openldap.ldif - a malformed LDIF
* missing_domain_simp_openldap.ldif- a copy of simp_openldap.ldif in which the
  domain entry used by openldap_to_389ds.rb to determine base DN (i.e., entry
  with `structuralObjectClass: domain`) has been removed.

The `src` directory contains LDIF files that were generated by the simp-core
LDAP test in order to populate the OpenLDAP server.  They are not used in the
the simp-utils tests, but are included for completeness.

* src/add_test_users.ldif - LDIF to add groups and users
* src/modify_test_users.ldif - LDIF to associate users with secondary groups
* src/force_test_users_password_reset.ldif - LDIF to set `pwdReset` to TRUE

NOTE: The `shadowLastChange` values for the src/ LDIFs were generated when the
      simp-core test was run and may need to be modified if you wanted to use
      them directly!
